type np problem

A friend of mine who studies at the Faculty of Mathematics asked me to help him convert a mathematical equation to solve an np-type problem and make a program that does the calculations.

The problem is to find the shortest path that makes us pass through all the cities in the fastest time, and here the importance of converting the mathematical equation into a program in order to help in the calculations becomes possible.

That's why I made this program to help him.....
